  CODE_GEN_PROMPT: dedent`
    Generate a complete, production-ready React project using modern best practices. Follow these strict requirements:

    ## PROJECT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
    - Create multiple functional components organized in logical folders
    - Use .js extension for all React component files
    - Implement proper component hierarchy and data flow
    - Include proper imports and exports for all components
    - Ensure all components are properly connected and functional

    ## STYLING AND UI REQUIREMENTS:
    - Use ONLY Tailwind CSS for styling (no custom CSS files)
    - Create beautiful, modern, responsive designs suitable for production
    - Implement proper mobile-first responsive design
    - Use semantic color schemes and proper spacing
    - Add hover effects and smooth transitions where appropriate
    - Include loading states and empty states where relevant

    ## REACT BEST PRACTICES:
    - Use functional components with React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
    - Implement proper state management and lifting state up when needed
    - Use proper event handling with preventDefault() where necessary
    - Implement proper form validation and error handling
    - Use React keys properly for lists and dynamic content
    - Follow React naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions)

    ## ICON AND MEDIA USAGE:
    - Use lucide-react icons ONLY when necessary from this list: Heart, Shield, Clock, Users, Play, Home, Search, Menu, User, Settings, Mail, Bell, Calendar, Star, Upload, Download, Trash, Edit, Plus, Minus, Check, X, ArrowRight
    - Import icons correctly: import { IconName } from "lucide-react"
    - Use placeholder image: https://archive.org/download/placeholder-image/placeholder-image.jpg
    - Use Unsplash images with valid URLs when appropriate
    - Add relevant emoji icons for better UX

    ## ALLOWED LIBRARIES (use only when specifically needed):
    - date-fns for date formatting
    - react-chartjs-2 for charts/graphs
    - firebase for backend integration
    - @google/generative-ai for AI features

    ## CODE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
    - Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
    - Include proper error boundaries and error handling
    - Implement proper loading states and user feedback
    - Use descriptive variable and function names
    - Add comments only for complex logic
    - Ensure all functions and components have single responsibility
    - Implement proper data validation and sanitization

    ## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - Ensure all interactive elements work correctly
    - Implement proper form submissions and data handling
    - Include proper navigation and routing if multi-page
    - Add proper accessibility attributes (aria-labels, alt text, etc.)
    - Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
    - Handle edge cases and empty states gracefully

    ## TESTING AND PRODUCTION READINESS:
    - Code should be free of syntax errors
    - All imports should be correctly resolved
    - Components should render without console errors
    - Implement proper prop validation with PropTypes or TypeScript-style comments
    - Ensure cross-browser compatibility
    - Optimize performance with proper React patterns

    ## RESPONSE FORMAT:
    Respond only with a valid JSON object. Wrap the response in triple backticks using json. Do not include any explanation, markdown, or comments â€” only the raw JSON structure.
    Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact schema:

    {
      "projectTitle": "Descriptive project name",
      "explanation": "Single paragraph explaining the project's structure, purpose, and key features. Include what makes it production-ready and user-friendly.",
      "files": {
        "/App.js": {
          "code": "Complete working React component code with proper imports and exports"
        },
        "/components/ComponentName.js": {
          "code": "Individual component code with proper structure"
        }
      },
      "generatedFiles": ["/App.js", "/components/ComponentName.js"]
    }

    ## CRITICAL ERROR PREVENTION:
    - Double-check all import statements for correctness
    - Ensure all JSX elements are properly closed
    - Verify all event handlers are properly bound
    - Check that all state updates follow React patterns
    - Ensure proper component composition and data flow
    - Validate that all Tailwind classes are standard classes
    - Test component logic mentally before including in response

    ## DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
    - Create visually appealing interfaces that users would want to use
    - Implement intuitive user experiences with clear navigation
    - Use consistent design patterns throughout the application
    - Ensure proper visual hierarchy with typography and spacing
    - Include micro-interactions and feedback for user actions
    - Design for accessibility and inclusivity

    Generate code that is immediately usable, error-free, and production-ready. Focus on creating a complete, functional application that demonstrates best practices in React development.
    Respond ONLY with a clean JSON object inside triple backticks using the application/json syntax. Do NOT include any explanation or markdown text.
